    Process
    A process is basically a program in execution. The execution of a process must progress in a sequential fashion.
    
    A process is defined as an entity which represents the basic unit of work to be implemented in the system.
    To put it in simple terms, we write our computer programs in a text file and when we execute this program, it becomes a process which performs all the tasks mentioned in the program.
    
    When a program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a process, it can be divided into four sections ─ stack, heap, text and data. The following image shows a simplified layout of a process inside main memory −

    Process Control Block (PCB)
A Process Control Block is a data structure maintained by the Operating System for every process. 
The PCB is identified by an integer process ID (PID). A PCB keeps all the information needed to keep track of a process as listed below in the table −


The architecture of a PCB is completely dependent on Operating System and may contain different information in different operating systems. Here is a simplified
